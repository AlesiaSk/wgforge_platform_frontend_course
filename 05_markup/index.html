          <h3>World of tanks</h3>
          <p>
            World of Tanks: Xbox 360 Edition offers three distinct game modes:
            Standard, Encounter, and Assault. Standard battles are intense
            "capture" scenarios where two teams attempt to secure the opposing
            base. Encounter battles offer only one base to capture, and teams
            fight tooth-and-nail to keep it. In Assault mode, players get a
            pitched battle between attackers and defenders during a single-base
            engagement.
