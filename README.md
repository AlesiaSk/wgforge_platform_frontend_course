## Reference

The Spectacle core API is available in the [Spectacle Docs](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.md).

## Getting Started

1. Download the boilerplate

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:FormidableLabs/spectacle-boilerplate.git
   ```

2. Remove existing version control

   ```sh
   rm -R .git
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the webpack server. The server will run at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

   ```sh
   npm start -- %presentation_name%
   ```

   E.g., following command will launch presentation from `00_introduction` folder

   ```sh
   npm start -- 00_introduction
   ```

5. To start new presentation copy boilerplate folder

   ```sh
   cp -a boilerplate %xx_presentation_title%
   ```


## Build & Deployment

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running

```sh
npm run build -- %presentation_name%
```
